# Crossword_Bot_Test

This bot will be used to test out the main Crossword_Bot that is hosted on PythonAnywhere.

Next step is to actually clone it from here, so that it works there. But for that, we'd have to have a switch to flip to redirect certain files to the PythonAnywhere address, rather than the local address. However, if everything is under one directory (Crossword_Bot) then it should work seamlessly.

This is a test update.
